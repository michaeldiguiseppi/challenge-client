## Frontend Coding Challenge

This is my solution for the FirstBaseHQ Frontend Coding Challenge

To run locally: 
1. Clone the [front-end-coding-challenge repo](https://github.com/FirstbaseHQ/frontend-coding-challenge) and run it on port 3000.
2. Create a .env file in the root of this project and put `REACT_APP_GRAPH_URL=http://localhost:3000` in it.
3. Run this project.

Note that I had to add CORS to the graph API project in order to run as a separate endpoint from this project.
